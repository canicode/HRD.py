# OBJECTIVE - Create code that when you input an age, it will tell/show what point in the main sequence it is in 
# I'm not entirely sure if that's correct, if someone can double check with Mike that would be really helpful (or where to begin as I'm 
# sure we can copy + paste stuff from already made scripts)
